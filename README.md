# predprodalzheimer
predict prodromal alzheimer
The aim of this project is that each time a medical practitioner inputs a new data (e.g. patient’s biological info, MRI image, EEG, NPT test, CSF, or …) into the application, the application will detect prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and calculate probability of progression to AD.
